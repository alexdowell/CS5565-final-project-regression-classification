- **Topics Covered:**  
  - Linear regression  
  - Polynomial regression  
  - Multi-linear regression  
  - Natural spline regression  
  - Model performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

### **Part 2: Feature Selection and Model Optimization**  
- **File:** CS5565_FinalProject_Part2_FeatureSelection_ModelOptimizationMethods.R  
- **Topics Covered:**  
  - Forward stepwise selection  
  - Backward stepwise selection  
  - Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and Adjusted RÂ² analysis  
  - Principal Component Regression (PCR)  

### **Part 3: Classification Models**  
- **File:** CS5565_FinalProject_Part3_Classification.R  
- **Topics Covered:**  
  - Logistic regression  
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
  - Decision tree classification  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification  

### **Project Report**  
- **File:** 5565 Final Project.pdf  
- **Contents:**  
  - Summary of regression analysis results  
  - Discussion of feature selection methods and model performance  
  - Interpretation of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity  

## Installation  
Ensure R and the required libraries are installed before running the scripts.  

### Required R Packages  
- tidyverse  
- caret  
- e1071  
- splines  
- glmnet  
- leaps  
- pls  
- tree  

To install the necessary packages, run:  
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "e1071", "splines", "glmnet", "leaps", "pls", "tree"))  

## Usage  
1. Open RStudio or an R console.  
2. Load the required dataset using `read.csv()`.  
3. Run the script using:  
   source("CS5565_FinalProject_Part1_Regression.R")  
   source("CS5565_FinalProject_Part2_FeatureSelection_ModelOptimizationMethods.R")  
   source("CS5565_FinalProject_Part3_Classification.R")  
4. View model summaries and results in the R console or through generated plots.
